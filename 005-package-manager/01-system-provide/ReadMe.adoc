== Introduction

Using your system provided packages is one of the oldest and most common form of package management solutions.
For this, you use your systems package installer (e.g. apt, yum) to install libraries and headers into common locations.
CMake can then use the `find_package()` function to search for these and make them available to your program.

== Examples

I have already shown how to do this in the link:../../001-basic/08-hello-3rd-party/[third party library] example from the basic section.
